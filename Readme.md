    1. In web browsers to store history.
    2. In WhatsApp, Instagram, and chat apps to show the latest message at the top.
    3. For undo function in Microsoft Office, Notepad, etc.

### Q2. Given a linked list, which algorithm is best to sort it ?

    Merge sort is often preferred for sorting a linked list. The slow random-access performance of a linked list makes some other algorithms (such as quicksort) perform poorly, and others (such as heapsort) completely impossible. 

### Q3. Which data structure is used for function calls and recursion ?

* FIFO

        FIFO is an abbreviation for first in, first out. It is a method for handling data structures where the first element is processed first and the newest element is processed last. 

        Real Life application

        1. Operating System uses fifo for job scheduling. 
        2. To handle congestion in networking queue can be used.
        3. Data packets in communication are arranged in queue format.
        4. Sending an E-mail, it will be queued
        5. While switching multiple applications, windows uses circular queue.

* LIFO

        LIFO is an abbreviation for Last in, first out is same as first in, last out (FILO). It is a method for handling data structures where the last element is processed first and the first element is processed last. 

        Real Life application

        1. Undo operation 
        2. Syntaxes in languages are parsed using lifo.
        3. It is used in many virtual machines like JVM.
        4. Forward – backward surfing in browser
        5. History of visited websites
        6. Message logs and all messages you get are arranged in stack
        7. Call logs, E-mails, Google photos’ any gallery , YouTube downloads, Notifications ( latest appears first )
        8. Scratch card’s earned after Google pay transaction.
